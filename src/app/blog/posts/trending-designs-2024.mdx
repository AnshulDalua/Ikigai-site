The "less is more" philosophy continues to dominate in 2024, with a focus on clean lines and subtle branding.

### Key Features:

Consider a small embroidered logo on the chest or sleeve of a high-quality, neutral-colored hoodie. At Couture, our precision embroidery can bring even the most delicate designs to life on custom embroidered hoodies.

## 2. Oversized and Empowered

The oversized trend isn't going anywhere, but in 2024, it's all about combining comfort with bold statements.

### Key Features:
- Extra roomy silhouettes
- Large, impactful graphics or text
- Dropped shoulders and extended sleeves

**How to Customize:**
Choose an oversized blank hoodie and add a large, screen-printed design across the back or chest. Our high-quality custom printed hoodies can handle even the most intricate and colorful designs.
