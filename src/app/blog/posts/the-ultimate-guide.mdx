## Choosing the Right Base: The Foundation of Your Personalized Hoodie

The journey to the perfect custom hoodie begins with selecting the right blank canvas. Here's what to consider:

### Fabric Composition

- **100% Cotton**: Soft, breathable, and great for everyday wear.
- **Cotton-Polyester Blend**: Offers durability and retains shape well.
- **Fleece**: Provides warmth and a cozy feel, ideal for custom winter hoodies.
- **Performance Fabrics**: Perfect for custom athletic hoodies, offering moisture-wicking properties.

### Weight and Thickness

- **Lightweight (5-7 oz)**: Great for layering or warmer climates.
- **Midweight (8-10 oz)**: Versatile for year-round wear.
- **Heavyweight (12+ oz)**: Provides maximum warmth and a premium feel.

### Style Options

- **Pullover Hoodies**: Classic style with a front pocket.
- **Zip-Up Hoodies**: Offer versatility and easy layering.
- **Oversized Hoodies**: On-trend and ultra-comfortable.
- **Cropped Hoodies**: Modern and stylish, popular in women's styles.

At Couture, we source our blank hoodies from top suppliers, ensuring that your personalized sweatshirt starts with a high-quality foundation.

## Customization Techniques: Bringing Your Design to Life
